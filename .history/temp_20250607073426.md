❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the scope of the function. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.
*   ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, limiting its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and`b` as arguments, making it clear what values it operates on.
*   ✔️ The function is now reusable, as it can sum any two numbers passed to it.

Further considerations:
* Consider adding input validation to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers.You could use `typeof a !== 'number'` to check the type.
* If the function is intended to sum an array of numbers, the implementation would be different(using a loop or`reduce`).Make sure the function name matches its intent.
